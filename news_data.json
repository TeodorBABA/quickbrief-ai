        "summary": "1. Iranul a început negocieri avansate cu China pentru achiziționarea rachetelor anti-navă supersonice CM-302, un acord care ar spori semnificativ capacitățile de atac ale Teheranului și ar reprezenta o amenințare pentru forțele navale americane din regiune.\n\n2. Acest potențial acord vine în contextul tensiunilor crescute între Iran și Statele Unite, care desfășoară o forță navală considerabilă în apropierea coastei iraniene, iar rachetele CM-302 ar încălca embargoul ONU asupra armelor din 2006.\n\n3. Relațiile militare dintre China și Iran se aprofundează, China manifestând sprijin pentru suveranitatea Iranului, în timp ce SUA se pregătesc pentru posibile acțiuni militare împotriva Tehranului în cazul unui impas în negocierile legate de programul nuclear al Iranului.",

        "summary": "1. Rusia avertizează că reluarea testelor nucleare de către SUA ar putea provoca un „efect de domino” și că responsabilitatea consecințelor ar reveni în totalitate Washingtonului.  \n2. SUA acuza China și Rusia de efectuarea unor teste nucleare secrete și planifică reluarea propriilor teste ca răspuns, subliniind că nu vor fi teste de amploare ca cele din trecut.  \n3. Ambasadorul rus a declarat că poziția SUA ar adăuga provocări Tratatului de interzicere totală a testelor nucleare (TICE), care nu a intrat în vigoare, având până acum doar Franța și Marea Britanie ca state ratificatoare.",

Curtea Constituțională urmează să finalizeze și să publice decizia referitoare la legea pensiilor magistraților în Monitorul Oficial, ceea ce va permite președintelui să procedeze cu promulgarea sau trimiterea legii înapoi în Parlament.
